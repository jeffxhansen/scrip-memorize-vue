# scrip-memorize-vue

This is a website developed through VUE that I have worked on in the past but haven't gotten around to finishing. It is designed allow users to upload text (scriptures) and then provide some functionality for them to memorize them and test their memorization. I implemented a really slick carousel interface so the user can swype through multiple scriptures that they are working on. I also have various confirmation and edit pages. There are also slick animations and styling using the Google Materialize library.
